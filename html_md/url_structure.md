# URL - Uniform Resource Locator

`scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename?name1=value1&name2=value2`

* scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
* prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
* domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
* port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
* path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
* filename - defines the name of a document or resource
* query string - When a server receives a request for such a page, it may run a program, passing the query string, which in this case is, `name1=value1` unchanged, to the program. The question mark is used as a separator, and is not part of the query string.
