# HTML Block and Inline


## Block-level Elements
Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The `<div>` element is a block-level element.



## Inline Elements

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline `<span>` element inside a paragraph.
