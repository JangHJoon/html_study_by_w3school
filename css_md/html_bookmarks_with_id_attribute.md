# HTML Bookmarks

HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.

Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long.

To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.

When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

## Example
First, create a bookmark with the id attribute:
`<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>`

Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:
`<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>`

Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page:
`<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>`
